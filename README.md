# aes

Advanced encryption algorithm

Takes 5 Clock cycles to output the ciphertext

Intending to implement as an ASIC co-processors or Cyptographic accelerator to do fast encryption and decryption 

--TODO--

Decryption 

Build interface to communicate with processor (SPI using FIFO)

Parallelise many ASIC co-processors for parallel 128 bit implementation
